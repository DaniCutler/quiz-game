# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

##Task
Build an app where a new user to coding is able to practice their skills with questions and answers about coding. User is able to click through a series of questions about 
code.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

## Technologies, Languages, Frameworks being used:

JavaScript- used to dynamically change the html and store-user input
HTML- used to create elements on the DOM
CSS- used for styling html elements on the page.
Bootstrap- Used for creating responsive structure and styling for this app.
Local storage- used to keep the variables and their values.


This was one of my first tasks in coding. I however had to go back and make some big changes. My tutor and I went through and worked on it to get it up and running.
I will say that I can really see the difference in my coding from the beginning to now. I am upset that the new student me did not console.log or pseudo code
so that I am able to disect the code and debug later. I really wanted to wipe it clean and start over, but my tutor suggested otherwise and that I should fix the suggested 
fixes and then  move on.
